# where to find the report
The report is located in the `report` folder and is named `report.pdf`.

# use of auto-generation tools

Auto-generation tools were used as follows:
- To help setup `Tensorflow` on a WSL2 environment to be able to use the GPU.
- Parsing error messages throughout the project.
- Assistance in formatting the report in $\LaTeX$, specifically with tables and referencing.

Auto-generation tools were not used elsewhere, for code generation, writing, or otherwise.
